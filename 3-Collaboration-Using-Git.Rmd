# Collaboration Using Git

## Collaboration

As much as time allows, we will demonstrate the following:

1. Pushing edits of code to the remote repository  
2. Pulling code from the remote repository
3. Managing and merging conflicts
4. Branching

## Example

From here on out, we will work from the following R Markdown file. 

`example_code/example_markdown.rmd`
