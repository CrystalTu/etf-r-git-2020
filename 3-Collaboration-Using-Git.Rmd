# Collaboration Using Git

## Collaboration

As much as time allows, we will demonstrate the following:

1. Pushing edits of code to the remote repository  
2. Pulling code from the remote repository
3. Managing and merging conflicts
4. Branching

## Common commands

```git status```

Requests the status tracked changes with in the repo

```git add .```

Stages tracked files to be comitted

The '.' tracks all chagned files.  Can also specify files to be tracked by naming them specifically or using regular expressions.

```git commit -m "informative message"```

Commits the files to be tracked.  

```git push```

Pushes committed files to the remote repository.

```git pull```

Pulls down and starts merge process of remote files if necessary.

## Example

From here on out, we will work from the following R Markdown file. 

`example_code/example_markdown.rmd`
