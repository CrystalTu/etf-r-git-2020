# Differential Equations in R

We take a quick pause from our git introduction to talk about differential equations in R.

R is best known as a statistical coding language, however, it is often important to incorporate other tools into your workflow to support modeling.

## deSolve

We will rely on the r package `deSolve`

```{r}
library(deSolve)
```

`deSolve` is an R wrapper to the [FORTRAN ODE solver](https://rdrr.io/cran/deSolve/man/lsoda.html)

As always, we'll use tools from the `tidyverse`.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Steps to solving differential equations with deSolve

1. Define your first order differential equations
2. Define parameters governing the differential equations
3. Define initial conditions
4. Define time step
5. Solve Differential Equations

## Real world example: SEIR 

In epedemeology, the SEIR equations govern the spread of a disease through a population.  

The S, E, I, and R represent four distinct population bins:

S: Suceptible
E: Exposed
I: Infected
R: Removed

A set of four differential equations govern a population's movement through these four bins.

![](img/seir.png)

$\beta$: Infectious rate - probability of transmitting disease between a susceptible and an infectious individual  
$\sigma$: 1 / time from exposed to infectiousness  
$\gamma$: 1 / time from infectiousness to recovery  

## SEIR Differential Equations using deSolve in R

### Define the Ordinary Differential Equations

```{r}
seir_ode <- function(t,Y,par){

  S<-Y[1] # Suseptible
  E<-Y[2] # Exposed 
  I<-Y[3] # Infected
  
  beta<-par[1] # this takes the first slot from the vector par that is passed in - it changes every time
  sigma<-par[2] # this takes the second slot from the vector par that is passed in - it remains constant
  gamma<-par[3] # this takes the third slot from the vector par that is passed in - it remains constant
  # mu<-par[4] # this takes the third slot from the vector par that is passed in - it remains constant
  
  dYdt<-vector(length=3)  ## this creates an empty vector of length 3
  dYdt[1]=-beta*I*S ## this is the formula for the suseptible population after the first step of the SEIR
  dYdt[2]=beta*I*S-sigma*E ## this is the formula for the exposed population after the first step of the SEIR
  dYdt[3]=sigma*E-gamma*I ## this is the formula for the infected population after the first step of the SEIR
  
  return(list(dYdt))
}
```

### Define Parameters

```{r}
beta <- 1/5
sigma <- 1/6
gamma <- 1/14

par<-c(beta,sigma,gamma)
```

### Define Initial Conditions

```{r}
iNot <- 1/1000 # proportion of population that is infected on day 1
eNot <- 1/100 # proportion of population that is exposed but not yet infected on day 1
rNot <- 0 # proportion of population that is removed on day 1
sNot <- 1 - iNot - eNot - rNot # proportion of population that is susceptible on day 1

init<-c(sNot,eNot,iNot)
```

### Define Time Steps

```{r}
t<-seq(0,365)
```

### Solve Differential Equations

```{r}
sol <- lsoda(y = init, times =  t, func = seir_ode, parms = par)

head(sol)
```

We'll return to this output in a second, but lets first take a deeper look at what is happening in `lsoda()`.

### What is going on under the hood?

```{r}
sol <- lsoda(y = init, times =  t, func = seir_ode, parms = par, verbose = T)
```

### How is `deSolve` doing the work?

Let's put in a few `print()` statements to help us learn.

```{r}
seir_ode_explore <- function(t,Y,par){
  
  print(str_c("S at time t = ", t," is: ", Y[1]))
  print(str_c("E at time t = ", t," is: ", Y[2]))
  print(str_c("I at time t = ", t," is: ", Y[3]))
  print(str_c("R at time t = ", t," is: ", Y[1]-Y[2]-Y[3]))

  S<-Y[1] # Suseptible
  E<-Y[2] # Exposed 
  I<-Y[3] # Infected
  
  beta<-par[1] # this takes the first slot from the vector par that is passed in - it changes every time
  sigma<-par[2] # this takes the second slot from the vector par that is passed in - it remains constant
  gamma<-par[3] # this takes the third slot from the vector par that is passed in - it remains constant
  
  dYdt<-vector(length=3)  ## this creates an empty vector of length 3
  dYdt[1]=-beta*I*S ## this is the formula for the suseptible population after the first step of the SEIR
  dYdt[2]=beta*I*S-sigma*E ## this is the formula for the exposed population after the first step of the SEIR
  dYdt[3]=sigma*E-gamma*I ## this is the formula for the infected population after the first step of the SEIR
  
  print(str_c("dSdt at time t = ", t," is: ", dYdt[1]))
  print(str_c("dEdt at time t = ", t," is: ", dYdt[2]))
  print(str_c("dIdt at time t = ", t," is: ", dYdt[3]))
  
  return(list(dYdt))
}
```

Lets see what this teaches us.

```{r}
t<-seq(0,1)

sol_explore<-lsoda(y = init, times =  t, func = seir_ode_explore, parms = par, verbose = F)
```

We can see from this output how `lsoda` is stepping through to numerically solve the differential equations.

## Explore Results

Results from `lsoda()`.

```{r}
head(sol)
```

### "Tidy" the output

This is confusing.  Let's clean it up.

```{r}

SEIR_Population <-
  sol %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(S = x1, E = x2, I = x3) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(R = 1 - rowSums(.[2:4])) %>%
  mutate(across(.cols = S:R, .fns = ~ . * 10000))
  
SEIR_Population
```

### Visualize Output

```{r}
SEIR_Population %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = S:R, names_to = "Bin", values_to = "Population") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = Population, color = fct_relevel(Bin, "S", "E", "I", "R"))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x= "Time", y = "Population", color = "Bin")
```
